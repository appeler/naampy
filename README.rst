The ability to programmatically reliably infer the social attributes of a person from their name can be useful for a broad set of tasks, from estimating bias in coverage of women in the media to estimating bias in lending against certain social groups. But unlike the American Census Bureau, which produces a list of last names and first names, which can (and are) used to infer the gender, race, ethnicity, etc., from names, the Indian government produces no such commensurate datasets. And hence inferring the relationship between gender, ethnicity, language group, etc., and names have generally been done with small datasets constructed in an ad-hoc manner.

We fill this yawning gap. Using data from the `Indian Electoral Rolls <https://github.com/in-rolls/electoral_rolls>`__ (parsed data `here <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MUEGDT>`__), we estimate the proportion female, male, and `third sex` (see `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender>`__) for a particular `first name, year, and state.`

Data
~~~~

In all, we capitalize on information in the parsed electoral rolls from the following 31 states and union territories:

How is the underlying data produced?
====================================

We split the name into first name and last name (see the python notebook for how we do this) and then aggregate per state and first_name, and tabulate `prop_male, prop_female, prop_third_gender, n_female, n_male, n_third_gender`. We produce native language rolls and english transliterations. (We use `indicate <https://github.com/in-rolls/indicate>`__ to produce transliterations for hindi rolls.)

This is used to provide the base prediction.

Given the association between prop_female and first_name may change over time, we exploited the age. Given the data were collected in 2017, we calculated the year each person was born and then did a group by year to create `prop_male, prop_female, prop_third_gender, n_female, n_male, n_third_gender`

Issues with underlying data
==============================

Concerns:

* Voting registration lists may not be accurate, systematically underrepresenting poor people, minorities, and similar such groups.

* Voting registration lists are, at best, a census of adult citizens. But to the extent there is prejudice against women, etc., that prevents them from reaching adulthood, the data bakes those biases in.

* Indian names are complicated. We do not have good parsers for them yet. We have gone for the default arrangement. Please go through the notebook to look at the judgments we make. We plan to improve the underlying data over time.

* For states with non-English rolls, we use libindic to transliterate the names. The transliterations are consistently bad. (We hope to make progress here. We also plan to provide a way to match in the original script.)

Gender Classifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start by providing a base model for first\_name that gives the Bayes
optimal solution---the proportion of people with that name who
are women. We also provide a series of base models where the state of
residence and year of birth is known.

If the name does not exist in the database, we use `ML model <https://github.com/appeler/naampy/blob/master/naampy/data/ml_model/02_training_model.ipynb>`__ that uses the relationship between
sequences of characters in the first name and gender to predict gender from the name.

The model was trained as a regression problem instead of a classification problem because men and women share names. (See the histogram below for the female proportion for the dataset.) The model predicts 
the female proportion of the name. If it is less than 0.5, we classify it as male; otherwise, we classify it as female.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first run `in_rolls_fn_gender`, it downloads data from `Harvard Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WZGJBM>`__ to the local folder. Next time you run the function, it searches for local data and if it finds it, it uses it.
Use `predict_fn_gender` to get gender predictions based on first name.
